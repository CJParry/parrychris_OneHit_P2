# Architecture (Game loop, level structure)  
Level begins with both players on opposite sides. Round is over when one player scores successful damage on the other player. This makes the sccene restart.
Players use 2 scripts as in future iterations we are likely to give different characters different stats/moves.

# Most technically interesting/challenging parts of prototype  
- Merging designers 3d background and other designers sprites/animatons into project
